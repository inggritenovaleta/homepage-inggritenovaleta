## How to make changes
Please refer to each project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting changes and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

- **Fork** the repo on GitHub.
- **Clone** the project to your local computer.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make necessary changes 
- **Commit** changes to your own branch. Please use one of these emojis to classify your contribution
    - :carousel_horse: : ideas to improve the project
    - :warning: : to correct my mistake

## Submitting changes

- Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Inggrit](https://github.com/inggritenovaleta/homepage-inggritenovaleta/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).<br>
- When you send a pull request, make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- Pull Requests without a personal comment will not be accepted until one is added.
