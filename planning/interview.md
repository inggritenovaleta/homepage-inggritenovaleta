Hence, i have presented you below a paraphrased summary of the interview.

* She detest to be employed and guided inside a box as equal as she hates **mathematics** - *Me too* :astonished:
 
* She has a BA degree in *French literature* but she has never considered it as a profession.

* She is currently enrolled for a Bachelor degree in **Marketing** at the [UCLL](https://www.ucll.be/).

knowledge in Development in general and *UX design* in particular. 
She has some experience in designing and she believes that she is gifted and good at it.

 she thinks that there is high level of linkage between the two domains. 
 The characters that these two domains (marketing and UX design) share in common are creativity, flexibility and independence)

* Her motive behind joining the [HYF](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/class-13-14) training is because 
She is more passionate about UX design (since “it has a deep link with her profession” - i.e Marketing)
besides it is because the Development domain is a demanding sector with competitive advantages in making high revenues and way of living.

 She has no back ground in coding.

* **Hobbies**

 She has a family who embraces music as a family trend. Her family has been serving in a choir since her early childhood.
 she grew up playing piano and guitar. And still, she plays them as hobbies. 

* **Personal characters**
 she is perfectionist, sociable but at the same time selective, she hates to be on the spotlight and usually prefers to stay at the back stage.
 However she is still capable of going public when there is a need.
 
* She is also environmentalist and has great concerns about it. She wants to contribute in protecting the environment.

* Her biggest strength is that she is **committed** and her weakness is that she is **doubtful** :thinking:

   > A balance between *hummer* and hardworking;        C r a z y   and committed person.

**Observation**

*Foot note*:

She wants to be presented as creative, independent, determined(committed), hardworking but at the same time easy going business woman(entrepreneur).
She wants to be discovered by Business personalities and entities, creative artists & designers.

The website should reflect her professional orientation (business woman) ambitions, personal characters, passions and hobbies.
